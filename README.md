# Reassuring-Parable-Generator
This is a python script as described in [XKCD 1263: Reassuring](https://xkcd.com/1263/)
It generates thousands of reassuring parables about things humans are better than computers at every second.
To use the program, enter the filename of the .cfg you would like to use.
There are two files included:
1. Reassuring.cfg - This is the standard reassuring parable generator.
2. self_reference.cfg - This is a test file I used while developing the script that generates statements about the text generator program.

To use the program, enter the filename and the number of strings to generate.

Sample output:
```
Enter config filename to use for text generation:reassuring.cfg
Enter number of strings to generate:20
